<h1> Â¡Text-To-Speech! </h1>

## ðŸ“ƒ Explanation 

**Hi guys, I have gone back to work on my "Text to speech" application and made some changes.**

ðŸ”¹ I have created a GUI for it.

ðŸ”¹ The application has a text box, where we can write the text we want.

ðŸ”¹ We have the option to choose between male and female voice.

ðŸ”¹ We can choose the speed when speaking between: Fast, Normal and Slow.

ðŸ”¹ It has a button called "Speak": The function of this button is to listen to the text we have written before.

ðŸ”¹ It has a button called "Save": The function of this button is to save the text we have written converted to voice, an example of saving is: text.mp3
